           <h3>Become a Web developer.</h3>
           <p>Web developers work independently as freelancers or with company teams to create websites. Depending on the job, these professionals may focus on front-end development, which involves designing sites and producing content, or back-end development, which involves writing code to make website features work. Web developers may also become webmasters for a site, providing maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting when needed.</p>
